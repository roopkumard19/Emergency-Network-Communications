Setting up Raspberry-Pi

1) Installing Raspbian OS onto the board by normal start,
	* Connect to an external monitor using HDMI cable, connect to an usb mouse and keyboard.
	* The board should be having the micro-sd card (mine came with Noobs pre-installed).
	* Noobs (New Out Of the Box Software) is an easy operating system installer which contains Raspbian OS along with others.
	* Select the OS you need and click install (The install will take several minutes)

2) Once the installation is done login to the Pi desktop, connect to the internet and do a "apt-get update".

3) From now on we dont need to have an external monitors, mouse or keyboard. We can login using Headless start by doing a ssh into the pi from a laptop.
+++++++++++++
4) For doing this, I would suggest setting a static IP to the pi.
	* Plug the micro-sd card using a card reader into your laptop.
	* Start by editing the dhcpcd.conf file (dhcp client daemon) in the Pi's filesystem (Please take a back-up of the file before editing),
		"sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf"
	* Append the following at the end of the file (Modify the IP according to your router's subnet),
		
		#For using the ethernet

		interface eth0  

		static ip_address=192.168.0.100/24
		static routers=192.168.0.1
		static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1
	
		#For using the wifi

		interface wlan0

		static ip_address=192.168.0.200/24
		static routers=192.168.0.1
		static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1

	* Now, the Pi's wifi interface is having the IP "192.168.0.200" and ethernet is having the IP "192.168.0.100".

5) Create a empty txt file and name it as "ssh" and put it in the boot folder of the Pi. This is done to enable the ssh in the pi.

6) Now put the micro-sd card back into your Pi and give the power supply.

7) From your laptop, if connecting thru wifi,(same goes for ethernet)
	* ssh into your pi using "ssh pi@192.168.0.200"
	* usually the password will be "raspberry".

Voila!!
